# Deskify 🚀 - Customize your Linux Desktop easily

> Note: This project is independent from the "Deskify" project for Android's Termux and serves a different purpose. While the other project focuses on getting Linux distributions on Android, this one is focused on configuring and automating desktop environments for Linux systems.
